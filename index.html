                    <h3>Solar Energy Implementation</h3>
                    <p>I led a transformative project in an extremely remote farm. Situated more than 40 kilometers away from the nearest power grid, I implemented solar panels to provide a sustainable energy source.

                        This brought remarkable improvements to the lives of the farm's workers. It enabled them to stay connected through cellphones, vital for emergency communication. Moreover, the solar power system illuminated their homes, powered fans and a fridge, meeting various daily needs.
                        
                        To ensure uninterrupted energy supply, I installed a battery system that stored excess energy generated during the sunlit hours, ensuring power availability even at night.</p>

                    <p>BAJA is a competition of off-road cars designed and built by students. I joined UCalgary's BAJA team with a pivotal role: designing the inaugural transmission system for their new off-road vehicle. This endeavor demanded a multitude of tasks, including extensive prototyping and meticulous machining to ensure every component seamlessly integrated.

                        In addition to hands-on work, I delved into complex SolidWorks drawings, translating concepts into precise blueprints. Collaboration was at the core of our success, and my team and I worked closely, often burning the midnight oil at the machine shop to meet project milestones.</p>

                    <p>For a class project, I developed a web scraping application that retrieved the schedule of men's World Cup games for the day. I then utilized a database to match the teams' flags and converted this data into RGB colors. This transformed information was transmitted to a Raspberry Pi programmed with Python, which controlled Nanoleaf panels in a prominent engineering hallway on campus. This creative project allowed everyone to visually and dynamically follow the day's World Cup games in real-time.</p>

                    <p>This was a transformative project focused on designing and implementing a comprehensive farm irrigation system and a functional water reservoir. My responsibilities encompassed project conception, management, and execution. The project's highlights included the creation of a substantial 300,000-liter reservoir, a pivotal component of our irrigation system. I also meticulously assessed project feasibility and costs, optimizing resource allocation and selecting high-quality materials for the reservoir, tubulation, and hydraulic pump, highlighting my technical and logistical expertise.</p>

                    <p>Collaborated with a team of four students to enhance an existing product, with a focus on circular economy principles. Targeting the issue of non-recyclable phone cases, we developed an innovative solution. Our phone case design reduced material usage by 40% compared to conventional cases and was compatible with 80% of smartphone models. Crafted from biodegradable, stretchable rubber, our design addressed sustainability and waste reduction. Leveraging SolidWorks, we created detailed 3D models to present our concept to professors and classmates, earning an A+ grade. </p>

                    <p>Designed and analysed a dual-purpose pumped hydro energy storage system, serving as both an energy storage solution and a water supply source for local irrigation. This versatile system utilizes a nearby river during off-peak hours to store energy by pumping water into an upper reservoir, later releasing it through a generation turbine during peak hours to generate electricity. To analyze the best option, I conducted in-depth theoretical analysis and optimization, including calculations for power requirements, material selection, pipe diameter determination, and force analysis on gates and dam walls. The project's outcomes showcase a practical solution for sustainable energy generation in rural settings.</p>
